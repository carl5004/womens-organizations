# Fellowship Activities

## The League of Women Voters

The League of Women Voters Stevens County was primarily concerned with political informing, but also were concerned about their own members. In 1972 they completed an informal survey during an annual meeting. 25 members completed the survey. The majority of members joined the League to learn about current issues and were interested in local issues. They split between liking to learn about current problems and discussing problems with the League. The majority wanted to see more action on community problems. 

## The Pomme de Terre Garden Club

The Pomme de Terre Garden Club held many fellowship activities throughout the years. Here are some listed by year.
