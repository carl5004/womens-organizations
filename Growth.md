# Personal Growth

## Framnas Jolly Workers

The Framnas Jolly Workers club was, of the three groups in this exhibit, the most concerned with personal growth. Lessons and open meetings conducted in the county from 1956-68: consumer protection; family life education; understanding teenagers; discipline in the home; as well as other lessons included in “[Fellowship Activities](liiiiiink).” Women in the group claimed they still enjoy new ideas as they cook, sew, keep house, and manage their lives.

In 1982 a supplement to the Morris Tribune, “Rural Women’s Appreciation Day” was published. An article in it, “Women’s Role Changes” was written by a woman named ___ Brandt from the Jolly Workers club. Mentions: women’s place used to be only in the home, and now they have the “homemaker working outside the home” role. Important to Brandt to continue your role in the community even if you are employed outside the home (which is why she goes to church and is in the club). She joined the Jolly Workers club in her first year of marriage and credit the extension program for the programs which have made her a better homemaker. She had good times learning new skills. Today, she says, the rural woman is a more active and informed business partner because of the workshops and organizations promoting the farm business.

## The Pomme de Terre Garden Club and League of Women Voters

While the League of Women Voters and the Pomme de Terre Garden Club were interested in the personal growth of their members, this has largely been placed under “[Fellowship Activities](liiiiink)” because there was a larger focus on growing the group as a whole.
