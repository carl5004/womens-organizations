# Political Activities

## The League of Women Voters

In all three groups, there were some activities that could be considered political. The Pomme de Terre Garden Club studied the problem of pollution in 1969 and hosted Don Timmons, a soil scientist at the USDA soil conservation research center at Morris. The Framnas Jolly Workers had lessons and open meetings conducted in the county from 1956-68, including town and country public affairs conference for women and election issues. But of the three groups in this exhibit, the League of Women Voters Stevens County was inclined to be the most political.

In 1971 the group organized many political activities: furnished a “Facts for Voters” column of public information for the Morris Sun and Tribune; maintained a pamphlet file in the Morris Public Library containing information on national, state, and local issues which is available to the public; provided a “Voter’s Voice” a 3-minute radio spot on KMRS Radio which communicated League studies to the public; sent out candidate questionnaires to all Stevens County School Board candidates last spring and made the replies available to the Stevens County newspapers for publication; prepared and distributed a Voter Information pamphlet previous to the School Board election; sponsored a unit in the Centennial Parade; “Womanned” a booth at the Stevens County Fair, offering information on national and state issues and distributing voter registration information to Morris residents; sponsored a bus trip to the State Legislature in February 1971 for Leaguers and their guests; helped with the Walk for Development; assisted the City of Morris with voter registration.

The group files at the Stevens County Historical Society and Museum contain a pamphlet not created by the League but the Minnesota Coalition to Support the ERA about the Equal Rights Amendment; it lists and counters many concerns about the ERA. It also lists the LWV as a supporter of the ERA. Conversely, there is also a letter in the files from the Homemakers’ United Efforts about the ERA and the negatives that it would produce. This is an example of the non-partisanship the League tried to endorse.

In 1983 the League conducted a study on the “Economic Status of Women in our Community”. Included in it were studies on the increasing importance of the roles that women play in the work arena and in the home, the continuing push for the Equal Rights Amendment, and the life experiences of local Leaguers. This study was about and for women of the 1980s in Stevens County, MN. The goal was to find out how local employers felt about women in the job market, what opportunities were open to women for employment in the area, and employer’s feelings about a wide variety of issues of interest to women. Three sections: Women at work outside the Home, Women’s Financial Security, and Women at Work in the Home.

## The Pomme de Terre Garden Club and Framnas Jolly Workers

Neither the Pomme de Terre Garden Club or the Framnas Jolly Workers were very politically oriented. They were more interested in developing the group through “[Personal Activities](liiiiink)” or “[Community Outreach](liiiiink).”
