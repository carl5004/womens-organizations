# Service and Community Outreach

## League of Women Voters

Service and community outreach and political activities were intertwined for the LWV. Their community outreach events were often to educate people on politics. This section is limited to less politically related activities of the LWV. To see more political activities, see the section "[Political Activities](liiiiiink)."

In 1983 alone, the LWV visited county jail and law enforcement center and the sheriff spent 1 hour reviewing his workload, budget, and concerns for the future; brown bag lunch with hospital administrators, with a presentation on administration set-up, budget, hospital board duties and concerns; scheduled to meet with county auditor/treasurer to study county financial statement.

The LWV did a city of Morris and Stevens County informational survey in 1975. The contents include: background on community, government structure and functions, government finances, popular control of government, administration of justice and public protection, planning and zoning, community utilities and transportation, public welfare, public health, education, parks and recreation, libraries and museums, housing and urban renewal, other governmental services.

The LWV sponsored a column in the Morris Sun about information for Health Care. Hosted talk about “Indians in Minnesota.” where there was a videotaped discussion by three Indian community and educational leaders.

In the 2000’s the League did a local water study, registered high school seniors to vote, provided immigration materials.

## Pomme de Terre Garden Club

The Pomme de Terre Garden club has been motivated by community outreach as part of their goals for the group. They claimed their purpose was to create an interest, especially in youth, in conservation and horticulture. Anyone who supports the purpose may be a member of the club.

Some of their projects in 2005 included: Planted flowers and maintained beds at the Stevens County Courthouse; presented awards to an outstanding member of 4H participating in horticulture at the Stevens County Fair; be mentors for 4H is asked; help at Horticulture Night at the West Central Research and Outreach Center if asked; supported new Minnesota Children’s garden; helped maintain new garden on Morris Library grounds; assessed area garden needs and where club might facilitate solutions to problems; planned and carried out a project to involve children by providing seems, helping them to bring a project to Stevens County Fair.

In 1989 the Garden Club: purchased a book for the public library; maintained the flower plot at Courthouse; held the annual mum sale; and presented awards to outstanding members of 4H participating in horticulture at the Stevens County Fair.

The Garden Club hosted the annual education conference of District 10 Minnesota Horticultural Society in 1989, with about 180 people in attendance.

Some of their recent community projects include: the plantings in front of the courthouse (something done since the state’s centennial year in 1958); planting trees at the School and at Green River Park; planting a wildflower garden at SCHS; donate a book on horticulture or gardening every year; and did a planting at the new Veteran’s memorial in Morris.

Plants were grown with 4the graders. Students grew plants in class and were then allowed to take them home. (A lot didn’t really make it.) Students then wrote thank you letters to the group.

## Framnas Jolly Workers

The Framnas Jolly Workers were more focused on the personal growth of their members than they were on community outreach. They did, however, participate in the Stevens County Fair, and held a booth on their club each year to promote membership and knowledge of the group. In 1973, the group performed a skit on “Getting Ready for the County Fair in the 1890s” for the 100th anniversary of the Stevens County fair.
