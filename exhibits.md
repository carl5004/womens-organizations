## Intro

Throughout the history of Stevens County, there have been many organizations. They have come in all shapes and sizes, and many were groups for or by women, including military support, political, and homemaker groups. In the archives at Stevens County Historical Society and Museum, there are a significant number of boxes dedicated to the history of women’s organizations. Why are there so many boxes? What did these groups do?

While women’s organizations in Stevens County don’t match feminism exactly they were important in providing a place for women (both theoretical and physical) through practicing promotion and outreach, skill development, and a sense of community. The way women were being built up was different within each group. The groups chosen for this exhibit are a sample of the kinds of women’s organizations that have existed in Stevens County. These are the Framnas Jolly Workers Homemaker Group, the Pomme de Terre Garden Club, and the League of Women Voters Stevens County Chapter. The Framnas Jolly Workers Homemaker Group started in 1938 and was connected to the University of Minnesota Extension service. The Pomme de Terre Garden Club started in 1953 and is still active today. The League of Women Voters Stevens County was active from 1970 to the late 1980s and again from 2006 to 2008.

Women’s organizations, in the modern context as we understand them today, have existed since the mid-1800s. Organizations reached a peak during the women’s suffrage movement in the early 1900s, and although these groups continued to flourish after World War II, little scholarly attention has been devoted to their work in those years.

Subjects that were taught through homemaker groups may seem antiquated by today’s standards but were important in women’s clubs. Early 1900s programs like clothing and shirt-making assistance helped women learn how to make clothing economically and professionally. A poultry project addressed feeding, increased egg production and health of the flock. Child development and health issues were studied. Assistance to families on relief during the Great Depression was addressed.

Later, when women’s roles shifted, so did the organizations. In 1975, clubwoman Lois Thielen in a homemaker program claimed the club’s purpose was “to educate homemakers in an informal setting, among their friends and neighbors, adjusting to a changing world, improving consumer skills and developing an awareness of how to improve the family unit.”

Some parts of women’s organizations have not changed over the years. Clubs strengthened collective confidence and afforded their members a more complete sense of individual identity. The club often served the cause of cultural enlightenment and taught women the value of their own autonomy. Clubwomen held the middle ground between women who wanted a radical break in social norms and the overwhelming majority who contentedly played out their conventional roles. They provided women with safe spaces to come together to discuss their lives and the problems they encountered as women. They also served, since their founding, as organizations that directed women's public action and political involvement. Examining the activism of women's clubs in these years reveals that they continued to allow women space to talk about their lives and others’ in varying ways. 

## Introductions to Each Group

# League of Women Voters of Stevens County

League of Women Voters of Stevens County was organized on November 10, 1970. It was part of the national organization, the League of Women Voters, an American civic organization that was formed to help women take a larger role in public affairs after they won the right to vote. Their goals were educational and nonpartisan. The Stevens County chapter was active from 1970 to the late 1980s, and again from 2006 to 2008.

The League of Women Voters Stevens County studied, discussed, and acted upon topics chosen nationally, state-wide, and locally. Local Leagues studied items of local interest and concern of their own choosing. The League was a non-partisan organization that did not support or oppose any candidate or political party. The League did, however, assemble pro and con information on issues, and also often supported progressive legislature. During election time, factual information about candidates was made available to help voters cast an informed vote. In addition to teaching women about the political process, the league also worked at the state level for the passage of legislation it saw as crucial to women’s lives, supporting laws pertaining to child welfare, education, women’s labor and living conditions, and anti-lynching.

The LWV was often working to gather information and background on different aspects of Stevens County and was very active in trying to inform local voters about local, state, and national politics. In a state survey of LWV chapters in 1983, the Stevens County chapter said the issue they saw as most important in their community was understanding funding of county government. The group claimed, “this, in turn, incorporates an understanding of the tax system at county and state level.”

One of the group’s chief challenges as a group was getting enough people to accomplish all that they intended to do, such as observe the county commissioner and other irregular monthly meetings.

# The Pomme de Terre Garden Club

The Pomme de Terre Garden Club was organized in 1953 and is still active today. They were originally called the Morris Garden Club but changed to Pomme de Terre Garden Club in 1955. They are a member of the “Heart of the Prairie” Tenth District Horticultural Society and the Minnesota State Horticultural Society. They had a program on vegetable gardening at the first meeting. Programs are slides, videos, demonstrations or talks, usually about something educational. Their Gardener’s Creed: “We believe a garden will bring us more than vegetables and flowers. We believe it will bring us contentment, relaxation, kind thoughts, peace of mind and joy in pleasant work and achievement.” Each year has a theme; for example, 1989 was Minnesota wild edibles, 1993 was toxic plants. Although not associated with the Extension service, in the past, several members have been Master Gardeners, who received training through the Extension Service and who were considered a good resource for the club and community.

An article by E.M. Hunt sums up what garden clubs typically do: The person speaking on the topic speaks but people end up adding to the information based mainly on personal experience and this turns into a group discussion much wider than the topic. One thing all clubs accomplish is a vast speed-up in communication and acceptance of new information and ideas -- a new idea, and particularly how-to-do-it information, still if most effective when it is passed on by direct contact with a personal touch. The individual joins the garden club because they want to get something that will enable them to improve the garden and the home. They begin to see the needs of the community and look for ways and means of doing something about it.

The group would often hold annual plant sales to fund the group, have a program each monthly meeting for learning about garden-related things, tour member’s and area gardens, and have an annual harvest supper made with produce from their gardens.

# Framnas Jolly Workers

The Framnas Jolly Workers was organized after a series of home extension lessons were given throughout the various townships in the county. Some of the first lessons were given on health by the Red Cross through the County Nurse; for example, sewing and raising chickens. The group started in the middle of the 1920s when Henry Brandt, a Framnas farmer, convinced six women to start a chicken project. “How to Cull a Chicken” was one of the first meetings, and a live chicken was used for the demonstration, to see which chickens lay eggs. (Extension groups often started this way by having lessons on chickens.)  The “Chicken Club” disbanded in 1930. The next group went by the name of the “Sewing Club.” The group was reorganized in 1938 to be the “Jolly Workers” and around the same time became a part of the Extension Homemakers. The tulip was chosen as the club flower. The club motto is: “to make the best better.”

Topics and skills were taught to members by the Extension group, and the members then taught their group about those things. As of 1984, they had 20 members and about 70% had jobs outside the home. The groups credits Home Extension for giving the Homemaker’s Groups many varied and interesting lessons through the years.

Hist of Extension Program: The Board of Regents of the U of M was authorized to establish an Extension division in 1909 under the Smith-Lever Act. The purpose of the Act was to, “Create and maintain a division of agriculture extension and home education in the Department of Agriculture at the University of Minnesota and to provide for the publication and distribution of home education bulletins and appropriating money therefor.” In 1916, President Wilson authorized the Emergency Food Production Act when world food supplies were low during WWI. Home economists traveled out to the people and taught classes on preserving and changing cooking and eating habits. This was Extensions’ first response to a major emergency. Many of the first “Chicken Clubs” in the country were a result of this focus.  The U of M Extension began to offer education opportunities to women in 1909. The Stevens County homemaker clubs formally began to join the U of M groups in 1927. Cheerful Helpers in 1912, Jolly Workers in 1938. Peaked in 1985 with 410 members.

Goals of the group: strive to promote a better way of life for my family, my neighbor, and myself through continuing education and community and service and support each other. I believe it is my privilege and responsibility to serve to the best of my ability and to continue to improve myself while helping others to develop to their full potential. May I always be willing to accept challenges of the day by building on the strengths of the past and looking with optimism to the future.

## Service and Community Outreach

# League of Women Voters

Service and community outreach and political activities were intertwined for the LWV. Their community outreach events were often to educate people on politics. This section is limited to less politically related activities of the LWV. To see more political activities, see the section "[Political Activities](liiiiiink)."

In 1983 alone, the LWV visited county jail and law enforcement center and the sheriff spent 1 hour reviewing his workload, budget, and concerns for the future; brown bag lunch with hospital administrators, with a presentation on administration set-up, budget, hospital board duties and concerns; scheduled to meet with county auditor/treasurer to study county financial statement.

The LWV did a city of Morris and Stevens County informational survey in 1975. The contents include: background on community, government structure and functions, government finances, popular control of government, administration of justice and public protection, planning and zoning, community utilities and transportation, public welfare, public health, education, parks and recreation, libraries and museums, housing and urban renewal, other governmental services.

The LWV sponsored a column in the Morris Sun about information for Health Care. Hosted talk about “Indians in Minnesota.” where there was a videotaped discussion by three Indian community and educational leaders.

In the 2000’s the League did a local water study, registered high school seniors to vote, provided immigration materials.

# Pomme de Terre Garden Club

The Pomme de Terre Garden club has been motivated by community outreach as part of their goals for the group. They claimed their purpose was to create an interest, especially in youth, in conservation and horticulture. Anyone who supports the purpose may be a member of the club.

Some of their projects in 2005 included: Planted flowers and maintained beds at the Stevens County Courthouse; presented awards to an outstanding member of 4H participating in horticulture at the Stevens County Fair; be mentors for 4H is asked; help at Horticulture Night at the West Central Research and Outreach Center if asked; supported new Minnesota Children’s garden; helped maintain new garden on Morris Library grounds; assessed area garden needs and where club might facilitate solutions to problems; planned and carried out a project to involve children by providing seems, helping them to bring a project to Stevens County Fair.

In 1989 the Garden Club: purchased a book for the public library; maintained the flower plot at Courthouse; held the annual mum sale; and presented awards to outstanding members of 4H participating in horticulture at the Stevens County Fair.

The Garden Club hosted the annual education conference of District 10 Minnesota Horticultural Society in 1989, with about 180 people in attendance.

Some of their recent community projects include: the plantings in front of the courthouse (something done since the state’s centennial year in 1958); planting trees at the School and at Green River Park; planting a wildflower garden at SCHS; donate a book on horticulture or gardening every year; and did a planting at the new Veteran’s memorial in Morris.

Plants were grown with 4the graders. Students grew plants in class and were then allowed to take them home. (A lot didn’t really make it.) Students then wrote thank you letters to the group.

# Framnas Jolly Workers

The Framnas Jolly Workers were more focused on the personal growth of their members than they were on community outreach. They did, however, participate in the Stevens County Fair, and held a booth on their club each year to promote membership and knowledge of the group. In 1973, the group performed a skit on “Getting Ready for the County Fair in the 1890s” for the 100th anniversary of the Stevens County fair.

## Personal Growth

# Framnas Jolly Workers

The Framnas Jolly Workers club was, of the three groups in this exhibit, the most concerned with personal growth. Lessons and open meetings conducted in the county from 1956-68: consumer protection; family life education; understanding teenagers; discipline in the home; as well as other lessons included in “[Fellowship Activities](liiiiiink).” Women in the group claimed they still enjoy new ideas as they cook, sew, keep house, and manage their lives.

In 1982 a supplement to the Morris Tribune, “Rural Women’s Appreciation Day” was published. An article in it, “Women’s Role Changes” was written by a woman named ___ Brandt from the Jolly Workers club. Mentions: women’s place used to be only in the home, and now they have the “homemaker working outside the home” role. Important to Brandt to continue your role in the community even if you are employed outside the home (which is why she goes to church and is in the club). She joined the Jolly Workers club in her first year of marriage and credit the extension program for the programs which have made her a better homemaker. She had good times learning new skills. Today, she says, the rural woman is a more active and informed business partner because of the workshops and organizations promoting the farm business.

# The Pomme de Terre Garden Club and League of Women Voters

While the League of Women Voters and the Pomme de Terre Garden Club were interested in the personal growth of their members, this has largely been placed under “[Fellowship Activities](liiiiink)” because there was a larger focus on growing the group as a whole.


## Political Activities

# The League of Women Voters

In all three groups, there were some activities that could be considered political. The Pomme de Terre Garden Club studied the problem of pollution in 1969 and hosted Don Timmons, a soil scientist at the USDA soil conservation research center at Morris. The Framnas Jolly Workers had lessons and open meetings conducted in the county from 1956-68, including town and country public affairs conference for women and election issues. But of the three groups in this exhibit, the League of Women Voters Stevens County was inclined to be the most political.

In 1971 the group organized many political activities: furnished a “Facts for Voters” column of public information for the Morris Sun and Tribune; maintained a pamphlet file in the Morris Public Library containing information on national, state, and local issues which is available to the public; provided a “Voter’s Voice” a 3-minute radio spot on KMRS Radio which communicated League studies to the public; sent out candidate questionnaires to all Stevens County School Board candidates last spring and made the replies available to the Stevens County newspapers for publication; prepared and distributed a Voter Information pamphlet previous to the School Board election; sponsored a unit in the Centennial Parade; “Womanned” a booth at the Stevens County Fair, offering information on national and state issues and distributing voter registration information to Morris residents; sponsored a bus trip to the State Legislature in February 1971 for Leaguers and their guests; helped with the Walk for Development; assisted the City of Morris with voter registration.

The group files at the Stevens County Historical Society and Museum contain a pamphlet not created by the League but the Minnesota Coalition to Support the ERA about the Equal Rights Amendment; it lists and counters many concerns about the ERA. It also lists the LWV as a supporter of the ERA. Conversely, there is also a letter in the files from the Homemakers’ United Efforts about the ERA and the negatives that it would produce. This is an example of the non-partisanship the League tried to endorse.

In 1983 the League conducted a study on the “Economic Status of Women in our Community”. Included in it were studies on the increasing importance of the roles that women play in the work arena and in the home, the continuing push for the Equal Rights Amendment, and the life experiences of local Leaguers. This study was about and for women of the 1980s in Stevens County, MN. The goal was to find out how local employers felt about women in the job market, what opportunities were open to women for employment in the area, and employer’s feelings about a wide variety of issues of interest to women. Three sections: Women at work outside the Home, Women’s Financial Security, and Women at Work in the Home.

# The Pomme de Terre Garden Club and Framnas Jolly Workers

Neither the Pomme de Terre Garden Club or the Framnas Jolly Workers were very politically oriented. They were more interested in developing the group through “[Personal Activities](liiiiink)” or “[Community Outreach](liiiiink).”


## Religious Activities

# The Pomme de Terre Garden Club, Framnas Jolly Workers, and League of Women Voters Stevens County

While some of the groups met at churches for their gatherings, none of the groups were especially religious or had religious activities or lessons (aside from the religious holiday crafting sessions or parties.


## Fellowship Activities

# The League of Women Voters

The League of Women Voters Stevens County was primarily concerned with political informing, but also were concerned about their own members. In 1972 they completed an informal survey during an annual meeting. 25 members completed the survey. The majority of members joined the League to learn about current issues and were interested in local issues. They split between liking to learn about current problems and discussing problems with the League. The majority wanted to see more action on community problems. 

# The Pomme de Terre Garden Club

The Pomme de Terre Garden Club held many fellowship activities throughout the years. Here are some listed by year.
