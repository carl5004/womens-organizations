# Introduction to Women's Organizations in Stevens County
This website is the home for a digital exhibit on women's organizations in Stevens County, Minnesota. 
It includes the Pomme de Terre Gardening Club, Framnas Jolly Workers, and League of Women Voters Stevens County.
This exhibit has a focus on digital humanities and what it means to be a feminist.

Throughout the history of Stevens County, there have been many organizations. They have come in all shapes and sizes, and many were groups for or by women, including military support, political, and homemaker groups. In the archives at Stevens County Historical Society and Museum, there are a significant number of boxes dedicated to the history of women’s organizations. Why are there so many boxes? What did these groups do?

While women’s organizations in Stevens County don’t match feminism exactly they were important in providing a place for women (both theoretical and physical) through practicing promotion and outreach, skill development, and a sense of community. The way women were being built up was different within each group. The groups chosen for this exhibit are a sample of the kinds of women’s organizations that have existed in Stevens County. These are the Framnas Jolly Workers Homemaker Group, the Pomme de Terre Garden Club, and the League of Women Voters Stevens County Chapter. The Framnas Jolly Workers Homemaker Group started in 1938 and was connected to the University of Minnesota Extension service. The Pomme de Terre Garden Club started in 1953 and is still active today. The League of Women Voters Stevens County was active from 1970 to the late 1980s and again from 2006 to 2008.

Women’s organizations, in the modern context as we understand them today, have existed since the mid-1800s. Organizations reached a peak during the women’s suffrage movement in the early 1900s, and although these groups continued to flourish after World War II, little scholarly attention has been devoted to their work in those years.

Subjects that were taught through homemaker groups may seem antiquated by today’s standards but were important in women’s clubs. Early 1900s programs like clothing and shirt-making assistance helped women learn how to make clothing economically and professionally. A poultry project addressed feeding, increased egg production and health of the flock. Child development and health issues were studied. Assistance to families on relief during the Great Depression was addressed.

Later, when women’s roles shifted, so did the organizations. In 1975, clubwoman Lois Thielen in a homemaker program claimed the club’s purpose was “to educate homemakers in an informal setting, among their friends and neighbors, adjusting to a changing world, improving consumer skills and developing an awareness of how to improve the family unit.”

Some parts of women’s organizations have not changed over the years. Clubs strengthened collective confidence and afforded their members a more complete sense of individual identity. The club often served the cause of cultural enlightenment and taught women the value of their own autonomy. Clubwomen held the middle ground between women who wanted a radical break in social norms and the overwhelming majority who contentedly played out their conventional roles. They provided women with safe spaces to come together to discuss their lives and the problems they encountered as women. They also served, since their founding, as organizations that directed women's public action and political involvement. Examining the activism of women's clubs in these years reveals that they continued to allow women space to talk about their lives and others’ in varying ways. 

## League of Women Voters of Stevens County

League of Women Voters of Stevens County was organized on November 10, 1970. It was part of the national organization, the League of Women Voters, an American civic organization that was formed to help women take a larger role in public affairs after they won the right to vote. Their goals were educational and nonpartisan. The Stevens County chapter was active from 1970 to the late 1980s, and again from 2006 to 2008.

The League of Women Voters Stevens County studied, discussed, and acted upon topics chosen nationally, state-wide, and locally. Local Leagues studied items of local interest and concern of their own choosing. The League was a non-partisan organization that did not support or oppose any candidate or political party. The League did, however, assemble pro and con information on issues, and also often supported progressive legislature. During election time, factual information about candidates was made available to help voters cast an informed vote. In addition to teaching women about the political process, the league also worked at the state level for the passage of legislation it saw as crucial to women’s lives, supporting laws pertaining to child welfare, education, women’s labor and living conditions, and anti-lynching.

The LWV was often working to gather information and background on different aspects of Stevens County and was very active in trying to inform local voters about local, state, and national politics. In a state survey of LWV chapters in 1983, the Stevens County chapter said the issue they saw as most important in their community was understanding funding of county government. The group claimed, “this, in turn, incorporates an understanding of the tax system at county and state level.”

One of the group’s chief challenges as a group was getting enough people to accomplish all that they intended to do, such as observe the county commissioner and other irregular monthly meetings.

## The Pomme de Terre Garden Club

The Pomme de Terre Garden Club was organized in 1953 and is still active today. They were originally called the Morris Garden Club but changed to Pomme de Terre Garden Club in 1955. They are a member of the “Heart of the Prairie” Tenth District Horticultural Society and the Minnesota State Horticultural Society. They had a program on vegetable gardening at the first meeting. Programs are slides, videos, demonstrations or talks, usually about something educational. Their Gardener’s Creed: “We believe a garden will bring us more than vegetables and flowers. We believe it will bring us contentment, relaxation, kind thoughts, peace of mind and joy in pleasant work and achievement.” Each year has a theme; for example, 1989 was Minnesota wild edibles, 1993 was toxic plants. Although not associated with the Extension service, in the past, several members have been Master Gardeners, who received training through the Extension Service and who were considered a good resource for the club and community.

An article by E.M. Hunt sums up what garden clubs typically do: The person speaking on the topic speaks but people end up adding to the information based mainly on personal experience and this turns into a group discussion much wider than the topic. One thing all clubs accomplish is a vast speed-up in communication and acceptance of new information and ideas -- a new idea, and particularly how-to-do-it information, still if most effective when it is passed on by direct contact with a personal touch. The individual joins the garden club because they want to get something that will enable them to improve the garden and the home. They begin to see the needs of the community and look for ways and means of doing something about it.

The group would often hold annual plant sales to fund the group, have a program each monthly meeting for learning about garden-related things, tour member’s and area gardens, and have an annual harvest supper made with produce from their gardens.

## Framnas Jolly Workers

The Framnas Jolly Workers was organized after a series of home extension lessons were given throughout the various townships in the county. Some of the first lessons were given on health by the Red Cross through the County Nurse; for example, sewing and raising chickens. The group started in the middle of the 1920s when Henry Brandt, a Framnas farmer, convinced six women to start a chicken project. “How to Cull a Chicken” was one of the first meetings, and a live chicken was used for the demonstration, to see which chickens lay eggs. (Extension groups often started this way by having lessons on chickens.)  The “Chicken Club” disbanded in 1930. The next group went by the name of the “Sewing Club.” The group was reorganized in 1938 to be the “Jolly Workers” and around the same time became a part of the Extension Homemakers. The tulip was chosen as the club flower. The club motto is: “to make the best better.”

Topics and skills were taught to members by the Extension group, and the members then taught their group about those things. As of 1984, they had 20 members and about 70% had jobs outside the home. The groups credits Home Extension for giving the Homemaker’s Groups many varied and interesting lessons through the years.

Hist of Extension Program: The Board of Regents of the U of M was authorized to establish an Extension division in 1909 under the Smith-Lever Act. The purpose of the Act was to, “Create and maintain a division of agriculture extension and home education in the Department of Agriculture at the University of Minnesota and to provide for the publication and distribution of home education bulletins and appropriating money therefor.” In 1916, President Wilson authorized the Emergency Food Production Act when world food supplies were low during WWI. Home economists traveled out to the people and taught classes on preserving and changing cooking and eating habits. This was Extensions’ first response to a major emergency. Many of the first “Chicken Clubs” in the country were a result of this focus.  The U of M Extension began to offer education opportunities to women in 1909. The Stevens County homemaker clubs formally began to join the U of M groups in 1927. Cheerful Helpers in 1912, Jolly Workers in 1938. Peaked in 1985 with 410 members.

Goals of the group: strive to promote a better way of life for my family, my neighbor, and myself through continuing education and community and service and support each other. I believe it is my privilege and responsibility to serve to the best of my ability and to continue to improve myself while helping others to develop to their full potential. May I always be willing to accept challenges of the day by building on the strengths of the past and looking with optimism to the future.
